# Sorting Algorithms Performance Simulator

This is a console application written in C# (.NET 8) that compares the performance of multiple sorting algorithms on arrays of different sizes and data arrangements. The goal is to analyze execution times and understand how each algorithm behaves under various conditions.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

All algorithms are executed automatically, one after the other, on the same dataset for comparison purposes.

## Features

- Array generation:
  - Random values
- Running sorting algorithms
- Execution time measurement for each sorting algorithm
- Console output with clear performance metrics

## Requirements

- .NET 8 SDK installed
- Terminal (Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, Linux/macOS terminal)

## How to Run

  **Clone or download the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndreeaRistea/SortingPerformanceSimulator.git
   cd SortingPerformanceSimulator
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
